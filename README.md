# Math Expertes Problem

The problem was to find the shortest mathematical expression containing an ascending sequence of natural numbers that is equal to 2021. By using reverse polish notation and bit encoding, I was able to search through all of the possible expressions (though there is a limit on factorials): multi-threading did help.

## The Result

The shortest solution found is: (1+2)!! + (3!)^4 + 5 = 2021.
